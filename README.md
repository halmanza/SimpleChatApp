# Simple Chat App

 ## Built using Node.js, Express, and Socket.IO for the backend and React.JS for the front end user interface.

 - A simple chat app that provides real time responses between users in a chat room. An initial room is created by the user and the following users just need to enter their display name and the same room name to be able to chat together. 

 -  ***I customized some componenets and how they would display but also benefited alot from following along with <h4> Pedro at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8S4rDRZn6Z_StJ-hh7ph8g. </h4> I'd recommend his video for a quick and concise overview of building this type of application.***
